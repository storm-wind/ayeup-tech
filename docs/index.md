# Technical notes so I don't forget

Some notes on how I got around some issues with my work within IT.
Most of the notes on here I have curated from different forums and blogs etc. These solutions worked for my situation so they may not work for your situation as I found this to be the case with a lot fo solutions out there for different problems.
